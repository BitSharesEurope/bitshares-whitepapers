Before diving into the mechanics of smartcoins, let us first briefly
review the smartcoin framework and describe which parameters are
available for customization of tokens as well as its autonomous and
transparent nature. Furthermore, we will describe the price feeds which serve
as \emph{oracle} to feed a trusted price into the blockchain.

Last but not least, we would like to address the distinction between publicly
and privately managed smartcoin tokens.

Please note that in most parts of this paper we will often refer to bitUSD or
bitCNY as examples for \emph{price-stable} smartcoins as they are available on
the BitShares Blockchain even though many more use case exist.
