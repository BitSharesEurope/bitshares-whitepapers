\label{sec:uia:priv}

A market-pegged crypto asset (a.k.a. SmartCoin) was the inspiration for
BitShares. With BitShares 2.0, users can create their own derivatives (i.e.
price-stable assets) with custom parameters designed to track the value of any
asset they can imagine by means of CFDs. The benefit of price-stable
crypto-currencies is that they are \emph{fully collateralized}, and the issuer
only needs to be trusted to appoint an honest set of independent
(non-collusive) feed producers. 

Unlike deposit receipts, the value of a privatized SmartCoin is secured even if
the issuer disappears (in this case, however, the asset may be declared
non-complying by regulators since white- and black-lists cannot be updated any
longer).

To create a privatized SmartCoin, Bitshares provides many parameters that an
issuer may tune. In addition to account whitelists, market restrictions, and
transfer restrictions, the issuer of a private SmartCoin has control over
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
 \item Collateral Type,
 \item Initial Collateral Rate,
 \item Maintenance Collateral Rate,
 \item Forced Settlement Fee, 
 \item Price Feed Update Rate,
 \item Settlement Delay, %, and Daily Volume %% (???????)
 \item Global Forced Settlement, and
 \item Trading and Withdrawal Fees
\end{inparaenum}

With these tools it is possible to emulate a pure contract for difference with
periodic global forced settlement (i.e., monthly, yearly, etc), or to emulate
BitAssets 1.0 by having a 30 day delay on forced settlement
(c.f.~\cref{sec:bitassets1}).

Hence, any arbitrary financial indexes can be used for the price feed to mimic
all manner of exotic assets. In addition with publicly auditable accounts even
mixed asset funds can be modelled with the advantage of verifiable ownership
claims by the fund manager.
