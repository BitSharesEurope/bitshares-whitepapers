With the current growth of the crypto- ecosystem in general, and the
growth of crypto- currencies like BTC (Bitcoin Blockchain) and ETH
(Ethereum Blockchain) in particular, the general public as well as
traditional (old economy) markets finally take notice of blockchain
technology and its application(s) in the financial technology and other
sectors. A well-known obstacle to greater adoption of crypto-currencies
like BTC (Bitcoin) as a medium of payment is the high volatility of its
exchange value, due to its limited supply. As a consequence, the unit
price varies (sometimes significantly) over short periods of time. This
makes BTC unpractical for merchants that need to pay their suppliers in
cash, especially in bearish markets where this currency risk can ruin a
business.

A crypto-currency, with the properties and advantages of Bitcoin, that
is capable of maintaining price parity with a globally adopted currency
(e.g. U.S. Dollar), has high utility for convenient and cheap commerce.

The following two subsections will discuss our discoveries about the
true nature of \emph{stable} or \emph{pegged} currency and explain how
BitShares treats this complex issue.
