In the BitShares network the base token is called \emph{a BitShare} and carries
the abbreviation \texttt{BTS}. It is dividable into $10^5$ sub-units called
\texttt{sdans}. % FIXME?! (super-decentral autonomous network unitS)

In general, all properties of Bitcoin also apply to BTS, namely, they have
value, can be transfered on the blockchain and are secured by elliptic curve
signatures.

In contrast to most cryptocurrencies, BitShares does not claim to be a currency
but rather equity in a decentral autonomous company (DAC). As a result, the
market valuation of BitShares is free floating and may be as volatile as any
other equity (e.g. of traditional companies).

Nonetheless, BTS tokens can be used as \emph{collateral} in financial smart
contracts~\cite{bts:financial} such as market pegged assets.

% FIXME what else?
