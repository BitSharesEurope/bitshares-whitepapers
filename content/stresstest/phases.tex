Since we use Graphene as our underlying technology, most blockchain parameters
can be changed in real-time with no need for protocol upgrades or hard forks.

In contrast to the public BitShares network, the majority of the stake in the
public testnet is owned by BitShares Europe and allows us to change the
parameters without the need to collude with other stakeholders.

This allows us to setup a multiphase stress-test that will go through a set of
different blockchain parameters to gradually increase the amount of
processed transactions on the blockchain.
