The core product of BitShares is a class of assets referred to as Market-Pegged
Assets (MPA), BitAssets, or SmartCoins and represent a crypto-token that has
\emph{at least} the value of the underlying asset. For instance, a bitUSD can
always be sold for \$1, either to a merchant at face-value, or to the network
(by means of settlement of a contract) in return for BitShares' core currency
(BTS) worth \$1.

In practice, a SmartCoin \emph{always} has 100\% or more of its value backed by
means of a collateralized loan between two parties with BTS as
collateral. What makes these loans unique is that they are free from
counterparty risk. This is achievable by letting the network itself
(implemented as a software protocol) be responsible for securing the collateral
and performing (forced) settlements if required as is described in more detail
in~\cite{bts:financial}.

Applications for SmartCoins are obvious: With the aforementioned properties, a
bitUSD qualifies for regular and instant payments, for example with a
smartphone or a modern browser application. In contrast, a bitGOLD (with one
ounce of gold as underlying asset) would fit those people's needs that see gold
as long-term store of value. As long as an asset has a unique global price, a
SmartCoin could track its value. This allows for even more sophisticated
applications, such as tracking a stock market index, or the price of a liter of
gasoline.
