Because BitShares can be accessed through an internet connection and there
exists only one source of truth, namely \emph{the blockchain}, there can only
exist one global order book for one particular market. The impact of such a
global unified order book would be to improve market efficiencies (reduce all
arbitrage opportunities), minimize spreads, maximize liquidity and provide
accountability and auditability. 

By having the trades executed on the BitShares network, it would eliminate all
high-frequency trading and front running because everyone has the same chance
of filling an order. High frequency trading and front running depend upon
centralized exchanges with high volume and deep markets. When the vast majority
of trading activity moves to a decentralized, trust-free exchange with open
order books, the remaining centralized exchanges will become much less
appealing to honest traders.

Furthermore, BitShares does not have restricted open hours, and is available
for trading 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.
