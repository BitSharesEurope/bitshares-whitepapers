Trade in Gold, Silver, Gas, and Oil in addition to your national currency and
crypto-currencies. Few limits exists on what can be traded on the BitShares
exchange, if enough people are interested to form a market. The DEX allows any
two pairs to be traded directly. There is no need to ask the exchange to open
up an additional market. If customers prefer to trade Silver:Gold directly,
they can simply do it. The BitShares exchange can support assets that can track
stocks, bonds, indexes, or inflation. Companies can issue their own stock on
the BitShares network and allow easy, low-cost trading with complete protection
against naked shorting.
