\label{sec:gateway}

Many gateways prefer the low-risk approach of one-for-one redemption and will
simply allow the GatewayUSD to float against BitUSD with a small but variable
spread in the market. Users then pay a small variable conversion cost as they
exit from BitUSD to fiat USD through GatewayUSD.

On the other hand, many users will want a direct conversion from BitUSD to fiat
USD. In this mode of operation, the gateway takes care of providing all of the
liquidity within a fixed percentage transaction fee. The gateways then
compete on offering the lowest possible spread.

Once this happens, BitUSD is effectively as good as USD with a small fixed
conversion fee. This fee will likely be no more than the withdraw and deposit
fees that current exchanges charge. At that point, BitShares will be a fully
operational exchange with many banking partners and no limits. At no point in
time will user deposits ever be subject to default or confiscation by an
exchange or gateway. A truly decentralized exchange will have been realized,
and the original vision of BitShares completed.
