The current implementation of market pegged assets in the BitShares system is
designed to minimize risk of loss to SmartCoin holders. The collateral
requirements and margin triggers were chosen conservatively to protect the
holders of market pegged assets from volatility of the underlying collateral.
Control over the price feed is distributed among $N$ separately elected feed
producers who compile information from multiple exchange sources.

Despite such precautions, it is important to carefully explore risks of using
the system. Risks can be broadly categorized as value risk, counterparty risk,
or systemic risk.
