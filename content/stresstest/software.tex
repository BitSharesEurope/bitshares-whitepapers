The software for the testnet backend has been maintained by BitShares Europe and is
available for review on github.com. It is an almost identical fork of the
Graphene code base that BitShares is built on with only marginal changes to
accommodate the separated blockchain.

The tools that have been developed for the stresstest and the analysis are
mostly available in separate repositories as well.
