Because BitShares can be access through an internet connection and there exists
only one source of truth, namely \emph{the blockchain}, there can only exist
one global order book for one particular market. The impact of such a global
unified order book is to improve market efficiencies (hence reduce all
arbitrage opportunities), minimize spreads, and maximize liquidity. By having
the trades executed on the BitShares network, we also eliminate high-frequency
trading and front running because everyone has the same chance of filling an
order. High frequency trading and front running depend upon centralized
exchanges with high volume and deep markets. When the vast majority of trading
activity moves to a decentralized, trust-free exchange with open order books,
the remaining centralized exchanges become much less appealing to traders.

% Talking about cryptocurrencies, once the market adopts BitUSD and BitBTC as
% more reliable and decentralized alternatives to BitstampUSD and BitfinexBTC,
% you will see the majority of trading volume move toward BitUSD vs BitBTC. The
% only time someone would want to move from BitUSD to BitstampUSD is when they
% are in the process of withdrawing to the traditional banking system.
