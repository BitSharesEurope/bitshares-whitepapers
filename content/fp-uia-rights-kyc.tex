First and foremost the issuer must know every single customer. BitShares
supports this by enabling both whitelists and blacklists. Rather than
requiring every issuer to whitelist every customer separately, an issuer may
specify a set of identity verifiers that they trust to do this job. This
allows issuers to benefit from the network effect of validated users without
having to do any direct identity verification themselves.

When an asset enables whitelists, no account may send or receive that asset
without being on an authorized whitelist. An accounts funds can be frozen by
removing them from the whitelist.
