BitShares offers entrepreneurs an opportunity to create their own SmartCoins
with custom parameters and price feeds.

User-issued SmartCoin managers can experiment with different parameters such as
collateral requirements, price feeds, force settlement delays and forced
settlement fees. They also earn the trading fees from transactions the issued
asset is involved in, and therefore have a financial incentive to market and
promote it on the network. The entrepreneur who can discover and market the
best set of parameters can earn a significant profit. The set of parameters
that can be tweaked by entrepreneurs is broad enough that SmartCoins can be
used to implement a fully functional prediction market with a guaranteed global
settlement at a fair price, and no forced settlement before the resolution
date.

Some entrepreneurs may want to experiment with SmartCoins that always trade at
exactly \$1.00 rather than strictly more than \$1.00. They can do this by
manipulating the forced settlement fee continuously such that the average
trading price stays at about \$1.00. By default, BitShares prefers fees set by
the market, and thus opts to let the price float above \$1.00, rather than
fixing the price by directly manipulating the forced settlement fee.
