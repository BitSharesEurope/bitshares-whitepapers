A prediction market~\cite{wiki_pm} is a specialization of SmartCoins where
there is no need for margin calls or forced settlement because all positions
are fully collateralized at any price. A prediction market has a price between
0 and 1 and the issuer settles all positions after the event occurs and the
final price is known.

Prediction markets are quickly implemented with BitShares and the DEX. All that
is needed a proper prediction criteria in the description of a newly created
asset that anybody can issue by putting up collateral. While the event has not
occurred, the price of this asset reflects the probability of an event to
occur. Participants that have voted correctly will be able to settle their shares
back to the network at a higher price and make a profit. This feature, in
combination with the bitUSD, allows to reimplement most binary prediction and
information markets currently established in a decentralized and trust-less
manner.

These prediction markets can be very secure if the issuer is a multi-sig
account with many independent and trustworthy parties involved.
