Unlike many attempts to create a digital asset that tracks the dollar, market
pegged asset are not an ``\emph{I owe you}'' issued by any entity. For this
reason, it does not rely on a specific counterparty to honor its value (unless
you choose to view the software protocol itself as an independent
``counterparty'' entity). 

Although manipulation risk occurs in any market, it is minimized by the open
source and auditable nature of the BitShares system and carefully considered
market rules. MPAs stored on a \emph{centralized} exchange become IOUs and are
subject to counter party risk~\cite{mtgox}. This risk is not a property of the
MPA themselves. We recommend that users never deposit their tokens on an
exchange and instead only use gateways that issue their IOUs onto the BitShares
network. This way you can trade your BitUSD against gateway IOUs without
exposing your BitUSD to counter party risk while in the order book (more
details in \cref{sec:gateway}).
