Before discussing a subset of potential use-cases in this paper, we first
present the tools and optional administrative rights given to the issuers of a
given (user-issued) asset.

For instance, banks are simply companies that maintain a database of customer
account balances and facilitate the transfer of these assets among their
depositors. Companies like Dwolla and Paypal essentially issue deposit
receipts, and then offer cheaper transfers among their users than between
banks. The deposit receipt example is probably one of the most important, and
yet most heavily regulated, use cases of user-issued assets.

With BitShares, it is now possible to move company-internal databases onto the
blockchain where deposits can be used with smart contracts such as the internal
markets, escrow, or bonds. In order to make traditional banking more profitable
(through a decentral account balance database) and incorporate services like
Paypal and Dwolla to their business model while offering more freedom to the
costumers we were talking to many different banks and exchanges, and have
learned a lot about what the law requires of those who wish to issue deposit
receipts. The following shall briefly discuss how BitShares can assist to
comply with those rules, technically.
