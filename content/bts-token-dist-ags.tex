The original grandmother prototype formerly called angel-shares (AGS) in
reference to the patron \emph{angels} who once funded the performing arts.
That's why AGS are \emph{not liquid}. (No one can trade the proof that you were
the once willing to donate to this cause.) 

The donations have been recorded in the public blockchain of bitcoin which now
acts as a \emph{book of honorable donors}. The bitcoin address used as donation
address was 
\begin{center}
 \texttt{1ANGELwQwWxMmbdaSWhWLqBEtPTkWb8uDc}
\end{center}
Note, that the donation period for AGS lasting 200 days has ended already and
that donations to this address never resulted nor will result in any
obligations whatsoever.

Since the social consensus includes AGS, the industry recommendation again is
to give at least 10\% to holders of AGS. Similar to BitShares PTS, the 47\% of
the total BTS supply have been sharedropped onto members of the AGS
mailing-list proportionally.
