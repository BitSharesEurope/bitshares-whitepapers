\emph{Proxy Voting} denotes the process of handing out ones voting power to
someone else. This process can be reverted to reclaim ones voting power.

The motivation behind proxy voting is to reduce voting apathy and allow active
shareholders to react more quickly to business and security concerns. That way,
misbehaving witnesses can be fired more rapidly.

That is centralizing in some respects, but it's controlled centralization in
the sense that nothing can happen too quickly and if shareholders don't like
which way it is going, still have the ability to switch courses. Compared to
classical crypto currencies (e.g. Bitcoin), this process is somewhat similar to
pooled mining with the exception that \emph{every} shareholder can participate
and only \emph{voting power} is handed over. Furthermore, this allows for
independent non-profit oriented decisions because there is no profit variance
but purely political influence.
