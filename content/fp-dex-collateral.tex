The heart of BitShares is the SmartCoin system which enables the creation of
collateralized IOUs from the BitShares network. A BitUSD has all of the
properties of Bitcoin combined with the price stability of the US dollar. At
any point in time you can sell a BitUSD for at least 1 dollar worth of BTS. If
at any time the value of the collateral falls below a certain point the
blockchain will automatically buy back the BitUSD with a dollars worth of BTS
(force settlement, see~\cref{sec:mpa}).

When you hold BitUSD the value of your holdings will remain pegged to the
dollar so long as BitShares have a value $>0$. This means that BitUSD is secure
against just about everything but an unfixable software bug in the BitShares
protocol itself. By the time BitShares matures to the level Bitcoin is at
today, we expect the probability of that kind of bug to be similar to that of
Bitcoin having such an event.
