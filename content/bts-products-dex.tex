As we have seen in the previous section, the BitShares network offers to
register different types of assets. It also allows for trading between
almost\footnote{The issuer of an asset may white-/or black-list trading
partners.} \emph{any two pairs} in an instant, trust-less and secure manner by
means of the BitShares Decentralized Exchange (DEX).

In traditional trading, a clearing house is necessary because trades are made
much faster than the cycle time for completing the underlying transaction.
Since in BitShares trades between two parties are performed on a global scale
in a decentralized network and no middlemen are required, there is no need for
settlement or clearing delays. If a trade in the DEX executes, the bought asset
instantly (T+0~\cite{t0}) appears in the customers wallet.

In combinations with SmartCoins, a startup could easily perform a
dollar-denominated crowd-funding without legal or tax implications due to the
velocity of cryptocurrency tokens. Furthermore, as all order-books are shared
on a global scale, the markets will become more efficient because no different
prices existing on different locations on earth. Of course, the DEX is open
24/7 and does not apply any limits to customers. A more detailed discussion
about the DEX can be found in a distinct paper~\cite{bts:financial}.
