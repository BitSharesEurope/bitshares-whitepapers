In todays world, crypto-currencies are unique in that they are the only digital
currency that is not someone else's liability. They are \emph{fungible},
\emph{decentralized}, and as \emph{valuable} as the network of users that
support them. Unfortunately, they suffer from very high volatility, because
their perception of value constantly changes as users enter and leave the
ecosystem. Although many professional traders appreciate this volatility, it
prevents its adoption as a \emph{payment} solution.

The traditional approach to creating a \emph{stable} asset is to accept
deposits and issue a digital token as a \emph{claim receipt} (i.e. ``I Owe
You''). Under this approach, the token is valued by the market as the
underlying asset, discounted by any credit risk associated with the issuer.
This can work well for transactions, but less well as a form of savings.
Furthermore, history has repeatedly proven that issuers eventually go bankrupt
due to fraud, incompetence, or government intervention.

More recent alternative approaches have used a crypto-currency as
\emph{collateral} in a \emph{contract for difference} (CFD)~\cite{def:cfd}.
Under this approach, two parties take opposite sides of a trade, where one
party is guaranteed price stability, and the other party is granted leverage.
This approach works as long as sufficient collateral exists, and the contract
can be settled by an honest 3rd party with a price feed.

These contracts are \emph{derivative instruments} and part of a wider
definition of \emph{financial instruments}. Since financial instruments are
defined as \emph{tradable} assets of \emph{any} kind they can (in general) be
cash, proof of ownership, or a contractual right to receive or deliver a
financial instrument. 

BitShares, as a decentral counterparty-trust-free platform for financial smart
contracts which operates over the internet, offers a set of financial
instruments including CFDs. Several other financial instruments are fully
implemented, one of which can act as a \emph{derivative} with \emph{cash} as an
underlying asset. These derivatives contracts derive its value from the
performance of an underlying entity and are thus often referred to as
\emph{market pegged assets} (MPA) or ``smart-coins'', and will be presented in
\cref{sec:mpa}.

Additionally, the BitShares platform provides an abstract feature known as
"user-issued assets" (UIA) to help facilitate a wide range of profitable
business models for certain types of services. The term refers to a type of
custom token registered on the platform, which users can hold and trade within
certain restrictions. The creator of such an asset publicly names, describes,
and distributes its tokens, and can specify customized requirements, such as an
approved \emph{whitelist} of accounts permitted to hold the tokens, or the
associated trading and transfer fees. These tokens allow for diverse use-cases
such as, for instance, ownership tracking, crowd fund raising, IOUs, coupons,
and many more and will be discussed in \cref{sec:uia}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% DEX
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In order to \emph{trade} financial instruments, BitShares provides a
high-performance \emph{decentralized exchange} (DEX), with all the features
expected from a trading platform (see \cref{sec:dex}). Any two assets that are
registered on the blockchain (MPA or UIA) may be traded against each other at
any time. Orders can be settled almost instantly up to at least 100,000
transactions per second.  With this kind of performance on a decentralized
exchange, there is no more need to risk funds in centralized exchanges.

% Last but not least, the BitShares bond market (currently not implemented fully)

% with any of your asset, or take a short position using any other asset as
% collateral.

In the following we will discuss the financial instruments available in the
BitShares network as well as the DEX. It is recommended to previously read
through the basic technological components of BitShares in the other white
papers~\cite{bts:general,bts:growth,bts:structure}.
