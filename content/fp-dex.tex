\label{sec:dex}

Throughout recent history, centralized exchanges have repeatedly proven
unreliable and untrustworthy. Whether it is MF~Global, Mt.~Gox, BitStamp, or
Bitfinex~\cite{mfglobal,mtgox,bitstamp,bitfinex}, many people have been cheated
because they allowed a 3rd party to hold their funds. It doesn't matter how big
they are, or how many auditors, regulators or insurers are involved, every kind
of fraud, abuse, and theft can and has occurred. In the modern financial
system, these transgressions happen all too frequently within centralized banks
and exchanges all around the world.

Hence, in the following paragraphs, we will outline the concept of the
decentralized exchange (DEX) that powers the BitShares network and discuss the
many benefits of using it has over traditional centralized exchanges.
