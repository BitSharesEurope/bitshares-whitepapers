There are many ways to profit from issuing an asset. As the issuer you have
complete control over market fees and can tune parameters such as the percent
of each trade that is collected as a fee. This percentage can be bound by a
minimum and maximum fee. The combination of these parameters give issuers
flexibility in pricing.

For example, you could easily implement a centralized payment solution on top
of the decentralized BitShares network and mimic the business model of Dwolla
and Paypal. In BitShares, you simply issue your own IOUs for U.S. dollars or
Euro and send them to the wallets of your customers. Whenever a customers buys
a market items from another customer, they may choose to pay with your IOU and
require a percentage or fixed amount as fee for your service. The major
advantage for your business is that you are not required to maintain your own
highly reliable database servers that contain your customers' balances since
your customers maintain their wallets on their own and the public ledger
securely stores the balances. This outsourcing increases security and profits,
and improves competitiveness at no extra cost.
