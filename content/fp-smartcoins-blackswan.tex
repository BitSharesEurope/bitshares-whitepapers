\label{sec:blackswan}

All guarantees of SmartCoins are subject to the caveat that a SmartCoin can
never be worth more than the collateral backing the \emph{least-collateralized}
short position. All collateral above this maintenance collateral limit is
effectively meaningless when it comes to enforcing the ``peg''. In normal
market conditions, the value of the collateral is always more than sufficient,
but, from time to time, markets can rapidly revalue the collateral.

If this revaluation happens faster than the short positions can be forced to
cover, then all SmartCoins are liquidated at the exchange rate of the least
collateralized short position. This is called a \emph{black swan} event since
the least collateralized position is unable to buy enough BitUSD to cover. At
this point, all positions are automatically force settled and any additional
collateral maintained by the shorts is returned to them. This is similar to an
insolvent bank converting its deposits to equity.
