In this section, we briefly describe which parameters are available to tune
custom smartcoins and their behavior in the market.

\begin{description}
 \item[short backing asset]: This defines the asset that has to be used for
       securing the loan. In other words, this represents the collateral asset.
       Once the smartcoin has been registered, this parameter may only be
       changed if the supply is zero.
 \item[feed lifetime]: The life time of a price feed as provided by oracles.
       Once a feed is older than this, it will be ignored. This ensure that
       feed producers need to publish feeds frequently.
 \item[minimum feeds]: The required minimum number of unique feed producers that
       published a valid price feeds to enable the smartcoin. If less than
       these are available, borrowing and margin calls (see below) are
       disabled.
 \item[force settlement delay sec]: Those that hold a smartcoin (e.g. bitUSD)
       can settle their smartcoin (see below) for their pro-rata share in the
       collateral.
       % This behaves similar to a debt equity swap if BTS = equity :D
 \item[force settlement offset percent]: This offset allows to reduce the
       percentage of collateral that can be obtained through settlement.
       If this is set to \SI{0}{\percent}, then a settlement of \SI{1}{bitUSD}
       will result in BTS worth \SI{1}{USD} (according to price feed) after the
       force settlement delay.
 \item[maximum force settlement volume]: This parameter limits the maximum
       amount of smartcoins that can be settled per maintenance interval.
\end{description}

These parameters are tied to the smartcoin and can be modified by its manager.
The prominent smartcoins bitUSD and bitCNY are managed by the BitShares
Committee -- a BTS voter approved group of trusted individuals.
