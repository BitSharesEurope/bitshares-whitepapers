In order for settlements to convert any smartcoin into the core asset (e.g. BTS
in the BitShares network) at a fair price, the blockchain needs to be aware of
the external price of BTS.

In BitShares, this is achieved by means of a set of $N$ trusted
\emph{delegates}. These delegates have to be elected by the corresponding
BitShares shareholders (e.g. holders of BTS) and can be constantly reviewed as
all prices are put on the blockchain in a public manner by means of
transactions of a particular type.

Having a set of $N$ prices $p_i,\;1<i<N$ for an arbitrary MPA on the
blockchain, the protocol obtains a single price $\tilde{p}$ by the use of the
\emph{median} according to:
\begin{align}
 x &= \operatorname{sort}(p_{i})\\
 \tilde p &=\begin{cases}
   x_\frac{N+1}{2}                                                & N \text{ odd}\\
   \frac {1}{2}\left(x_{\frac{N}{2}} + x_{\frac{N}{2} + 1}\right) & N \text{ even.}
 \end{cases}
\end{align}

Hence, this price is resistant against misbehaving delegates in such as only
majority of published prices (for a particular MPA) can manipulate the outcome
of the median and hence the price from blockchain perspective.

Obviously, the shareholders are required to constantly monitor the published
prices of their delegates and should make public note about discrepancies.
