In the following section, we describe the mechanics of smartcoins in
detail. These include the price feeds in \cref{sec:feeds}, the
collateral in \cref{sec:collateral} with its requirements, the creation
of call orders~\cref{sec:callorder} for borrowing as well as settlements
in~\cref{sec:settlement}.

It is worth noting that the behavior of the smartcoin mechanics depends
on smartcoin-specific parameters such as \emph{maintenance collateral ratio},
\emph{short squeeze protection ratio}, or \emph{backing asset}. These
parameters and their effects will be described in detail below.
