With BitShares your trades execute in seconds, just like any centralized
website interface. Unlike centralized exchanges, there can be no prioritized
trading, front running, or hidden orders. This puts all traders on a level
playing field.

On Wall Street, traders go to great lengths to get as physically close to the
exchange systems as possible, because their trading bots make decisions so
quickly that the speed of light is a considerable factor. Thus distinct fiber
cables are put in the ocean between London and New York to improve
profitability in Europe. A decentralized exchange is \emph{location-neutral},
and gives everyone equal opportunity.
