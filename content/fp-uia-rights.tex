Banks are simply companies that maintain a database of customer account
balances and facilitate the transfer of these assets among their depositors.
Companies like Dwolla and Paypal essentially issue deposit receipts, and then
offer cheaper transfers among their users than between banks. With BitShares,
it is now possible to move these internal databases onto the blockchain where
the deposits can be used with other smart contracts such as the internal
markets, escrow, or bonds.

In talking to many different banks and exchanges, we have learned a lot about
what the law requires of those who wish to issue deposit receipts.
