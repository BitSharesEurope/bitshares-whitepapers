\label{sec:bitassets1}

The first proposal of the BitAsset system has evolved over 9 months since it
first launched as we learned how market participants reacted to various rules.
We notices that, liquidity is critical to confidence in the value of the token
and that a system with unbalanced rules will tend to bias the price in one
direction or the other.

Early on, BitUSD was driven down to \$0.85 as demand for shorting outstripped
demand for BitUSD and shorts were not forced to cover. Then, after implementing
a \emph{30 day forced covering rules}, the price stabilized around \$0.98 to
\$1.00. Later, as the cryptocurrency bear market progressed, we had BitUSD
trading at \$1.05 or more because everyone is scared to use leverage and those
that have open positions looked to cover their position while those who held
BitUSD were not looking to sell. Over the course of these past 9 months, we
have seen 3 different markets and had an opportunity to better understand the
behavior of market participants and improve the protocol accordingly.

We have seen that the idea of a market pegged crypto token can in general work,
but obviously, we were not satisfied as to \emph{how well} BitAssets 1.0
worked. For that reason, the improved BitAssets 2.0 protocol was proposed which
will be described in the following.
