Merchants around the world offer rewards points for loyal customers. These
points are accumulated to earn discounts on future purchases. Rewards systems

smart contracts.

Furthermore, because the issuer can set a trading fee for their UIA, merchants
can have an additional revenue stream from people trading their rewards points.
