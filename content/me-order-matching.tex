When we were planning Graphene one of the features we wanted to have was
"market orders" - user specifies only amount and buy or sell order executes at
current market price. So in Graphene order can be executed in the same block
it's placed and also it can be marked as "fill or kill" - this makes market
orders much easier to implement. Now we only need to add simple buy/sell/short
form to the GUI where user can specify amount, click Place button, agree with
price and confirm.
