Software and music licenses can be made transferable by issuing them as a
digital asset. Every copy of a program can check to make sure that the user has
control of a token before running. Software implementing such a licensing
scheme can remain functional even if the company that produced the license goes
out of business.

Trading cards can be simulated by creating many limited issue assets. Online
games can use these assets to represent game items.

Further related possibilities include, but are not limited to: ownership
tracking, authorization, membership identifications, etc.
