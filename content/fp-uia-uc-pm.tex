With BitShares and the decentral exchange described in \cref{sec:dex},
prediction markets~\cite{wiki_pm} are quickly implemented. A binary prediction
market has a ``price'' between 0 and 1 representing the two possible outcomes
of an event. All that is needed is a proper prediction criteria in the
description of a newly created asset that anybody can issue by putting up
collateral. 

Hence, a prediction market is a specialization of SmartCoins where there is no
need for margin calls or forced settlement because all positions are fully
collateralized at any price. 

While the event has not occurred, the price of this asset reflects the
probability of an event to occur. After the event has occured the issuer can
settle all positions at final ``price'' depending on the actual outcome.
Participants that have voted correctly will be able to settle their shares back
to the network at a higher price and make a profit.

These prediction markets can be very secure if the issuer is a multi-sig
account with many independent and trustworthy parties involved.

This feature, in combination with the bitUSD, allows to reimplement most binary
prediction and information markets currently established in a decentralized and
trust-less manner.
