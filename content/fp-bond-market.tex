Not every short seller will be happy with the rules offer by SmartCoins. Some
may want to borrow for a fixed period of time, with higher leverage, and with
no risk of being force-settled. BitShares offers these speculators the option
to borrow BitUSD on the bond market at interest. The bond market allows
speculators to leverage any asset against any other, while lenders earn
interest on collateralized loans. A Bond market is the perfect way for the
market to establish a yield curve on SmartCoins and free both sides of the
market from dependency on the price feed.
