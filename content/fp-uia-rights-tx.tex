A transfer-restricted asset allows the holders of the asset to trade it in the
markets but not transfer it from person to person. Only a few cryptocurrency
exchanges allow user-to-user transfer of funds outside the market, because this
particular activity is often subject to a different set of money transmission
regulations. For that reason, known exchanges make use of so called coupon
codes if there is a customer demand for user-to-user transfers.
