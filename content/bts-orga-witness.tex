In BitShares, the witnesses' job is to collect transactions, bundle them into a
block, sign the block and broadcast it to the network. They essentially are the
block producers for the underlying consensus mechanism (see
\cref{sec:consensus}).

For each successfully constructed block, a witness is payed in shares that are
taken from the limited reserves pool at a rate that is defined by the
shareholders by means of approval voting.
