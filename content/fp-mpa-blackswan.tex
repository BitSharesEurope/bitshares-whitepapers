\label{sec:blackswan}

All guarantees of SmartCoins are subject to the caveat that a SmartCoin can
never be worth more than the collateral backing the least-collateralized short
position. All collateral above the maintenance collateral limit is effectively
meaningless when it comes to enforcing the peg. In normal market conditions,
the value of the collateral is always more than sufficient, but, from time to
time, markets can rapidly revalue the collateral.

% A black swan event occurs whenever the least collateralized position is
% unable to buy enough BitUSD to cover.

If this revaluation happens faster than the short positions can be forced to
cover, then all SmartCoins are liquidated at the exchange rate of the least
collateralized short position.
%
At this point, all positions are force settled and any additional collateral
maintained by the shorts is returned to them. This is similar to an insolvent
bank converting its deposits to equity.
