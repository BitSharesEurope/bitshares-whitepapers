\begin{abstract}%

  Ever since Satoshi Nakamoto released his whitepaper and corresponding
  software for bitcoin, the cryptocurrency ecosystem has continued to grow at a
  rapid pace. In the beginning, Bitcoin created a platform that anyone could
  use to \emph{transfer} value across the internet without middlemen, banks or
  counterparty risk.  However, once bitcoin's basic blockchain consensus
  technology became established and stable, people began to discuss whether
  blockchain technology could also be applied to enable the \emph{trade} of
  multiple assets without the need for a broker or centralized clearinghouse.
  BitShares has created such a technology, and has coined the term
  "\emph{decentralized exchange}" (DEX) to describe our Bitcoin 2.0 platform.
  Currently, it supports trade not only in digital assets, but also traditional
  financial instruments and securities on the blockchain. The two main tools we
  provide for the creation of these instruments, market pegged assets (MPA) and
  user-issued assets (UIA), are discussed in detail in this paper.
