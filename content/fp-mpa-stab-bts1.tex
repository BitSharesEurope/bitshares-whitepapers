The first iteration of the market-pegged asset engine evolved for over 9
months as we observed how market participants reacted to various rules.
We noticed that liquidity is critical to bring confidence in the value
of the token, and that a system with unbalanced rules will tend to bias
the price in one direction or the other.

Early on, BitUSD was driven down to \$0.85 as demand for shorting
outstripped demand for BitUSD and shorts were not forced to cover. Then,
after implementing a \emph{30 day forced covering rule}, the price
stabilized around \$0.98 to \$1.00. Later, as the cryptocurrency bear
market progressed, BitUSD was trading at \$1.05 or more because everyone
was scared to use leverage and those that had open positions looked to
cover their position while those who held BitUSD were not looking to
sell. Over the course of these past 9 months, we observed the dynamics
of 3 different markets and thus had the opportunity to refine our
understanding of the the behavior of market participants and improve the
protocol accordingly.

While we saw that the idea of a market pegged crypto token was generally
well accepted in the marketplace, we were not yet satisfied as that the
system had been perfected. For that reason, we improved the BitAssets
engine for the BitShares 2.0 protocol, now called smartcoins.
