A BitShares bond offer defines the \textbf{amount and type of collateral} and
the \textbf{type of borrowed asset}. A \textbf{ratio} of borrowed asset to
collateral is specified. A bond offer can be partially filled at this ratio as
long as it is above a specified minimum. Bonds have a defined \textbf{loan
period}, \textbf{minimum loan period}, and \textbf{interest rate}.
