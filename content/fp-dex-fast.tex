With BitShares your trades execute in seconds, just like any centralized
website interface. Unlike centralized exchanges, there can be no
high-frequency trading, front running, or hidden orders. This puts all traders
on a level playing field.

On Wall Street, traders go to great lengths to get as physically close to the
exchange systems as possible, because their trading bots make decisions so
quickly that the speed of light is a considerable factor. A decentralized
exchange is location-neutral, and gives everyone equal opportunity.
