An issuer who offers both USD and EUR deposits may need to restrict direct
trading between their USD and EUR assets to avoid being subject to foreign
currency exchange regulations. Some cryptocurrency exchanges allow trading
between fiat and cryptocurrencies, but not between two fiat currencies.
Without this feature, many exchanges would be unable to issue their assets on
the BitShares blockchain.
