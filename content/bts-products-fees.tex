In the BitShares ecosystem every operation is assigned an \emph{individual} fee
that has to be payed in the core asset (BTS) the the end user. These fees are
subject to change and are defined by the elected committee members. Thus each
and every shareholder of the BitShares core asset (BTS) has a say as to what
the fees should be. If shareholders can be convinced to reduce a certain fee
and consensus is reached, the fee will be reduced automatically by the
blockchain. This allows the ecosystem, to stay flexible and adept the price for
the usage of its products over time.

Since the network expects the fees to be payed on the the core asset (BTS) but
many users may not want to hold any, the protocol allows to trade an arbitrary
asset into BTS from the asset-specific *fee pool* at the *core exchange rate*
which is defined by the issuer (or the witnesses in the case of a market pegged
asset).
