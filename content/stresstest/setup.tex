We have deployed a separated blockchain for the public testnet that has been
launched in January 2016. That blockchain was open to the public and every new
account has been donated some of the core assets called \texttt{TEST}. By the
time of the stress-test, the blockchain had over \num{6800000} blocks,
and over \num{25000000} operations processed.
