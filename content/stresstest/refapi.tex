A bare bone reference node is provided by BitShares Europe that allows
participants to interface with the Peer-2-Peer network without running their
own full-nodes. The endpoint is available at
\texttt{wss://node.testnet.bitshares.eu} and is powered by an Intel Core i7 with
64GB of RAM which carries two fully balanced full nodes to deal with the
traffic.

A frontend-wallet is provided under \texttt{https://testnet.bitshares.eu}.
