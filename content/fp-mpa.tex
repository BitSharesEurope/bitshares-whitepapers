BitShares' market pegged assets (MPA), or \emph{Smartcoin} (as they is often also
called) are a new type of freely traded digital asset whose value is meant to
track the value of a conventional asset such as the U.S. dollar or 1 ounce
of gold. What makes market pegged assets unique is that they are free from
counter party risk.

A currency with the properties and advantages of Bitcoin that maintains price
parity with a globally adopted currency such as the US dollar has high utility
for convenient and censorship resistant commerce. A SmartCoin (synonym for
Market Pegged Asset) is a cryptocurrency that always has 100\% or more of
their value backed by the BitShares core currency, BTS, to which they can be
converted at any time at an exchange rate set by a trustworthy price
feed\footnote{Price feeds are published by delegates that have shareholder
approval.}. 
 
This paper will explain how market pegged assets including (for instance)
\emph{BitUSD} (intended to track the value of the US dollar) achieve price
parity while minimizing risk to holders.
