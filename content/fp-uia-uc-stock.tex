Corporate shares are heavily regulated in most countries by their corresponding
exchange authority, such as the \emph{Securities and Exchange Commission} (SEC)
in the U.S.

However, none of those regulations prevent them from being issued or traded on
an alternative trading system~\cite{altTrade}. The regulations in many
jurisdictions require all shares to be registered (a.k.a. held by known
identities). 

Since the BitShares network offers whitelisting for costumers of UIA according
to \cref{sec:uia:restrictions}, corporate shares can certainly be issued and
traded in the BitShares Decentralized Dex (see \cref{sec:dex}).

% Additionally, BitShares corporate shares can be used as collateral for a bonds
% or be used in any number of smart contracts.
