\label{sec:settlement}

Any long position (i.e. holder of smartcoins) can request a so called
\emph{settlement} to convert their position into the collateral. The settlement
has a asset-specific delay and settles at the settlement price minus an offset
that is defined by the token management.

Settlements are covered by collateral provide by the call positions that have
the least collateral ratio. If a single all position is insufficient to cover
the settlement, the next position with least collateral will be used and so on.

However, there is a limit to the amount of smartcoins that can be settled per
\emph{maintenance interval} which can be updated by the token management.

Furthermore, the settlement offset is paid by the person requesting settlement
to the person providing the collateral as a compensation.
