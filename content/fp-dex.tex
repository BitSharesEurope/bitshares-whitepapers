\label{sec:dex}

Throughout history, centralized exchanges have repeatedly proven unreliable and
untrustworthy. Whether it is MF~Global, Mt.~Gox, BitStamp, or
Bitfinex~\cite{mfglobal,mtgox,bitstamp,bitfinex}, many people have been cheated
because they allowed a 3rd party to hold their funds. It doesn't matter how big
they are, or how many auditors, regulators or insurers are involved, every kind
of fraud, abuse, and theft can occur and has occurred. In the modern financial
system, these transgressions happen all too frequently within centralized banks
and exchanges operating across the world.

Hence, in the following paragraphs, we introduce the decentralized exchange
(DEX) within the BitShares network and discusses the benefits of using it in
contrary to centralized exchanges.
