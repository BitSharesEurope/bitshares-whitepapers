An issuer who offers USD, EUR and other fiat deposits may need to restrict
direct trading between their fiat assets to avoid being subject to foreign
currency exchange regulations. Some crypto-currency exchanges allow trading
between fiat and crypto-currencies, but not between two fiat currencies.
Without this feature, many exchanges would be unable to issue their assets on
the BitShares blockchain. Hence, an issuer may chose to also white- or
blacklist trading partners for their user issued assets (i.e. IOUs). This way,
the issuer can prevent customers from trading USD-IOUs for EUR-IOUs without
restricting other pairs. Fortunately, MPAs, such as the bitUSD are not fiat and
hence need not be blacklisted.
