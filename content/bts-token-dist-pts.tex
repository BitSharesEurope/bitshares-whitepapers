The original grandfather prototype, formerly called proto-shares (PTS),
BitShares PTS was a simple minable cryptocurrency (similar to Bitcoin) that
was created to allow people to advertise their interest in receiving free token
samples in future DACs. PTS functions as a high-tech \emph{mailing list} for
distributing free sample bitshares from many developers of decentral autonomous
companies (DACs). The only people who tended to own PTS tokens were those who
understand DACs, so DAC developers prefer to target them with free samples
rather than \emph{air dropping} their samples onto a much less interested
general population.

The industry recommendation was that when a DAC is launched, at least 10\% of
the DAC's total tokens are given proportionally to holders of PTS. This was not
a contract or a guarantee; it was a \emph{social consensus} of those in the DAC
community about what percentage of a new DAC's tokens should be distributed to
those who have supported the BitShares industry by owning its PTS tokens.

The BitShares DAC honored this social consensus and even sharedropped 47\% of
its ever existing supply onto BitShares PTS holders.
