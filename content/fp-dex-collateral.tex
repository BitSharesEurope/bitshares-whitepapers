The heart of BitShares is the SmartCoin system which enables the creation of
200\% collateralized IOUs from the BitShares network. A BitUSD has all of the
properties of Bitcoin combined with the price stability of the US dollar. At
any point in time you can sell a BitUSD for at least 1 dollar worth of BTS. If
at any time the value of the collateral falls below a certain point the
blockchain will automatically buy back the BitUSD with a dollars worth of BTS.

When you hold BitUSD the value of your holdings will remain pegged to the
dollar so long as BitShares itself has reasonable volatility. Reasonable
volatility in this case means that it can handle greater volatility than
Bitcoin has ever seen in its lifetime. The price of BitShares would have to
fall to less than 1/3 its starting price in less than 24 hours and then stay
there. No legitimate, widely adopted cryptocurrency has ever seen that kind
of price movement. This means that BitUSD is secure against just about
everything but an unfixable software bug in the BitShares protocol itself. By
the time BitShares matures to the level Bitcoin is at today, we expect the
probability of that kind of bug to be similar to that of Bitcoin having such an
event.
