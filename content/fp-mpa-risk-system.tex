Systemic risk is a catch-all for other risks required to utilize the system.
The primary risk is individuals are responsible for protecting the
cryptographic private keys that sign transactions proving ownership of assets.
These keys must be protected from theft or loss. This risk can be greatly
reduced and virtually eliminated by following best practices. Systemic risk
also includes the possibility of an overlooked fatal flaw in the open source
software or the possibility of large scale failure of global network
infrastructure.
