Once the market adopts BitUSD and BitBTC as more reliable and decentralized
alternatives to BitstampUSD and BitfinexBTC, you will see the majority of
trading volume move toward BitUSD vs BitBTC. The only time someone would
want to move from BitUSD to BitstampUSD is when they are in the process of
withdrawing to the traditional banking system.

The impact of a global unified order book is to end all arbitrage
opportunities, minimize spreads, and maximize liquidity. By having the trades
executed on the BitShares network, we also eliminate high-frequency trading and
front running. High frequency trading and front running depend upon
centralized exchanges with high volume and deep markets. When the vast
majority of trading activity moves to a decentralized, trust-free exchange, the
remaining centralized exchanges become much less appealing to high-frequency
traders.
