The first proposal of the BitAsset system has evolved over the 9 months since
it first launched as we learned how market participants reacted to various
rules. Liquidity is critical to confidence in the value of the token. A system
with unbalanced rules will tend to bias the price in one direction or the
other. Early on, BitUSD was driven down to \$0.85 as demand for shorting
outstripped demand for BitUSD and shorts were not forced to cover. Then, after
implementing 30 day forced covering rules, the price stabilized around \$0.98 to
\$1.00. Later, as the bear market progressed, we now have BitUSD trading at
\$1.05 or more because everyone is scared to use leverage and those that have
open positions look to cover their position while those who hold BitUSD are not
looking to sell. Over the course of these past 9 months, we have seen 3
different markets and had an opportunity to better understand the behavior of
market participants.

In order for BitUSD to be accepted as being equal to \$1.00 for the purposes of
setting prices and online shopping, it only needs to maintain a \emph{floor} of
\$1.00. If it can maintain a floor of \$1.00, then merchants can accept it and
know their margins are safe and that they are not exposed to currency risk. In
order to enable a guaranteed floor, all BitUSD can be force liquidated at a
trustworthy price feed the hour. If this rule is present, then those who create
the BitUSD must sell it at a price that properly accounts for this risk of so
called \emph{forced settlement}. This means that at almost all times new BitUSD
will only enter circulation when there is a buyer willing to pay a premium for
a guaranteed floor.

As we will see, since USD holders can initiate so called \emph{global
settlement}, there is no need for artificial forced covering every 30 days.
This relieves shorts of risk, helps increase short demand, and keeps the price
of BitUSD near the floor.
