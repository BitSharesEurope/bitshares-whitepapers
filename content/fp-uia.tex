In addition to the aforementioned market pegged assets, BitShares allows
individuals and companies to issue their own tokens for anything they can
imagine. The potential use cases for user-issued assets (UIA) are innumerable,
and the regulations that apply to each kind of token vary widely, and are often
different in every jurisdiction. BitShares provides the tools to allow issuers
to remain compliant with all applicable regulations when issuing assets.
