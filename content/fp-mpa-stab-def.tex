Before we discuss how BitShares achieves price \emph{stability} we first need to
define what properties make a currency \emph{stable}.

In the U.S., for instance, the Federal Reserve (FED) has a mandate of
\emph{stable prices} and it is almost universally accepted that this is a good
mandate. The same holds true for the Euro with its stability being
\emph{controlled} by the European Central Bank (ECB). Mostly every
country/nation or federation applies a similar concept to gain control over
prices via monetary policies like quantitative easing and interest rates for
commercial banks that borrow money from the central bank.

As a very basic example, imagine a central bank managed to keep prices stable
through their monetary policy with 0\% price inflation over 20 years. Now lets
assume that during this same 20 years the advances in robotics and automation
resulted in a 3x increase in efficiency and thus there are now 3x as much food,
cars, phones, houses, etc. For the sake of this example we will assume the
population is the same and everyone has the same amount of money in the bank.
You would normally expect that everything would be 1/3 the price and that
everyone would be able to afford 3x their prior life style. But because of the
central bank's intervention they have managed to also increase the money supply
by 3x. The newly created money is then borrowed to the commercial banks which
borrow it again to the people at a profit.

Since this monetary inflation is a sustained increase in the general level of
prices, it is equivalent to a decline in purchasing power of money.  Hence, a
dollar buys less and less over time. As a result, we see the dollar losing 99\%
of its \emph{purchasing power} since the FED was founded in 1913~(see
\cref{fig:monetarybase}).

Of course, the goal of this paper is not to propose a replacement of central
banks or their monetary policies, but to clarify the terminology in particular
with regards to ``stable'' cryptocurrencies. Some other projects in the
cryptocurrency space are attempting to provide an alternative currency that can
achieve the exact same mandate as the central banks and leave the profits in
the hands of only few institutional entities. However, we do not want to bring
this same mandate to crypto currencies but instead aim for a decentralized
\emph{market-peg}.

Let us discuss the example above: Since, we see a decreasing purchasing power
over time, we notice that price \emph{stability} is not too important.
Obviously, we would rather achieve a \emph{stable purchasing power}. However,
since we want to \emph{peg} to the dollar, which simply doesn't show a
\emph{stable value}, we, for now, cannot aim for this. What we want to achieve
instead is 
\begin{itemize}
 \item a \emph{predictable} price with \emph{reduced volatility}
 \item a somewhat reliable ability to \emph{predict the future value} of a token, and
 \item a unit of account that doesn't have any meaningful capital gains or
       losses for tax purposes.
\end{itemize}

Hence, for us, price ``stability'' means price \emph{predictability} within
some tolerance level. In the case of the U.S. dollar, a willingness to accept a
yearly loss in purchasing power via monetary policies, demonstrates that
predictability is more important than stability~\cite{bm:stable:impossible}.

Alternatively, BitShares offers a decentralized solution to implement the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) to peg to the changes in the price of a market
basket purchased by regular households. This way, a stable crypto token (that
must not be denoted in dollar, etc.) can trade with constant purchasing power.
