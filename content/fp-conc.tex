In this paper, we have described the foundations of the BitShares network,
which we hope will soon begin to inspire a paradigm shift from classical
banking towards peer-to-peer financing. We have laid out the many features and
benefits of the BitShares Decentralized Exchange, which offers financial
instruments for anyone to utilize with low barriers to entry.

With SmartCoins, the BitShares ecosystem offers a powerful tool for everyone
from speculators and savers, to traders and entrepreneurs.

The order-matching algorithm is similar to most central exchanges, and allows a
user to directly fill an existing order or walk-the-books up to a given price
by means of a limit order. It also allows for trade of any arbitrary pair of
assets issued on the BitShares blockchain.

The BitShares platform provides a toolkit with which innovators can experiment
to discover optimal currency solutions using free market trading.

We also discussed how a price floor of \$1.00 USD per bitUSD is the most
reasonable approach to achieving price predictability.

Additionally, we have shown that user issued assets (UIA) offer countless
opportunities to reduce costs. They can be used to distribute a token on a
decentralized database (the blockchain), and can be programmed to comply with
government regulations. Since the BitShares protocol handles order processing
and storage of user balances, any implementation of business models around UIAs
comes at very low cost to the issuer and will make expensive central server
infrastructure a thing of the past.
