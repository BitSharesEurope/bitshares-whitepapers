The base tokens of BitShares 2.0 will be distributed on a 1:1 basis fully
honoring the BTS tokens in the BitShares 1.0 network.

For the sake of completeness, the following paragraphs will describe the
initial distribution of BTS tokens in the aforementioned BitShares 1.0 network.
Two possibilities have existed to get BTS prior the launch as a pre-allocation
in the Genesis block back in 2014.

There, fairness was defined by equal opportunity and in the case of BTS we have
50\% distributed \emph{fairly} by CPU mining of BitShares-PTS tokens in the PTS
network~\cite{}. Alternatively, with AGS everyone had an additional equal
opportunity whether they have \$1 per day to contribute or more~\cite{}. Let us
discussion both schemes briefly.
