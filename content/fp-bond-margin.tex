To avoid the need for margin calls, the bond market assumes that the collateral
is always sufficient for paying off the loan, even if its value has fallen
below the value of the loan. In other words, every bond is the combination of
a loan and an option to buy the collateral at the payoff price. The lender is
responsible for ensuring that the interest rate and collateral is sufficient to
cover the cost of providing the implied option contract.
