The roles that traditional exchanges perform today encompass:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Receiving cryptocurrency and issuing IOUs.
 \item Receiving fiat and issuing IOUs.
 \item Processing an order book.
 \item Redeeming IOUs.
\end{enumerate}

Each of these stages requires a high degree of trust and direct counterparty
risk, because they involve an IOU from the exchange. To get the best
liquidity and lowest spreads requires a large and active order book, and this
means that most people gravitate toward a few core exchanges, leaving everyone
exposed to the same counterparty risk.

Moving money into or out of an exchange often incurs a significant time delay,
which means that active traders must keep their funds on the exchange. This
magnifies the amount of risk to users of the exchange. It also magnifies the
risk to all users in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Each large security breach
results in significant sell pressure, from both the thief looking to cash in
their loot, and from regular users hoping to sell before the thief.
