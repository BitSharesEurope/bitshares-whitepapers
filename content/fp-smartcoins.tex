In today's world, crypto-currencies are unique because they are the only type
of digital currency that does not represent a corresponding counterparty
liability. Instead, they are \emph{fungible} \emph{decentralized} tokens, whose
value is derived from the amount of practical utility (or potential future
utility) perceived by the network of users that support and trade in them.

Not surprisingly, most cryptocurrencies suffer from high levels of price
volatility due to many complex factors, such as constantly shifting
public perception and highly speculative and unregulated markets.
Although professional traders tend to appreciate this volatility, so far
it has hindered the widespread adoption of cryptocurrency as a
\emph{practical payment solution}. A cryptocurrency that has the
properties and advantages of Bitcoin, but is also capable of maintaining
price parity with a globally adopted currency (e.g. U.S. dollar), would
have incredible high utility for convenient and fast e-commerce.

The BitShares Blockchain tries to solving this problem by introducing
smartcoins - a framework for collateralized counterpartyrisk-free loans
that enable token that highly correlate with the valuation of an
underlying asset, such as U.S. Dollar.

These loan contracts are implemented as smart contracts and strictly
follow pre-defined and publicly known behavior. In the case of our
collateralized loans, the smart contract becomes the lender and requires
a security from the borrow in form of another digital token. Hence,
anyone can borrow new bitUSD from the blockchain by providing sufficient
BTS as collateral. The smart contract autonomously and transparently
ensure that each bitUSD in existance is backed by more than 100\%
(mostly even more than 175\%) of its value in BTS. Same holds true for
bitCNY. It is worth noting that the smartcoin framework allows for
customizing many of the parameters to improve behavior and stay flexible
in the longer-term. Given the nature of smart contracts on a public
blockchain, all actions are transparent and auditable. Acountability is
baked into the protocol.

What makes smartcoins unique is that they are free from counterparty
risk even though they resemble a loan backed by collateral. This is
achieved by allowing the network itself (implemented as a software
protocol) to be responsible for securing the collateral and performing
settlements and margin calls to ensure sufficient backing. This will be
described in greater detail below.
