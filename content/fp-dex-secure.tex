Every Dollar, Euro, bitcoin and ounce of gold held as a SmartCoin on the
BitShares exchange is backed by at least 100\% of the reserves of traditional
centralized exchanges. The traditional banking system has long practiced what
is call \emph{fictional} reserve banking, more commonly known as
\emph{fractional} reserve banking. In the Bitcoin ecosystem, we demand at least
100\% reserve. A single hack, mistake, or theft can quickly turn a 100\%
reserve system into a fractional reserve system, or worse, a no reserve system.
Without any reserves, it is unlikely that an exchange can give you the funds it
owes you.

By always maintaining reserves, you can rest assured that BitShares is solvent
in almost any market. All of the reserves are kept as BTS held in collateral on
the blockchain, and they cannot be stolen, because there are no private keys
that can be compromised to steal all of the reserves.
