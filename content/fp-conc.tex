SmartCoins are a powerful tool for everyone from speculators and savers, to
traders and entrepreneurs. The BitShares platform provides a toolset with which
innovators can experiment to find optimal currency solutions using free market
discovery.

BitShares market pegged assets are a viable open source alternative to the
incumbent banking system. Achieving price parity with a commonly used currency
facilitates pricing and acceptance by merchants. Additionally it reduces the
need to calculate capital gains and losses on volatile assets to determine tax
liability. While certain risks of the system have been outlined, no system is
without risk. The current banking system allows private funds to be frozen or
confiscated without consent, such as by court order or administrative actions.
Banks and financial institutions are susceptible to insolvency. The
availability and quality of banking service varies greatly throughout the
world. BitShares brings publically auditable open source banking to anyone with
access to the internet. Market pegged assets allow savers and spenders to
choose preferred asset types. This brings flexibility and ease of use to the
open source banking experience.

The Bitshares bond market allows investors who wish to gain leverage in a
particular asset to offer competitive interest rates to those willing to commit
capital for a specified time. The implementation of a bond market on a
blockchain consensus system efficiently reduces the overhead and counterparty
risk typically associated with such contracts.
