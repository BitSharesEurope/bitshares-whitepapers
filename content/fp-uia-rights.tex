In principle, traditional banks are simply companies that maintain a database
of customer account balances and facilitate the transfer of these assets among
their depositors. Companies like Dwolla and Paypal essentially issue
\emph{deposit receipts}, and then offer cheaper transfers among their users
compared to banks. The deposit receipt example is probably one of the most
important, and yet most heavily regulated, use cases of UIAs. For that reason
we will describe the tools available in BitShares that allow for compliant
deposit receipts on the blockchain.

Therefore, with BitShares, it is now possible to move company-internal
databases onto the blockchain where deposits can make use of smart contracts
such as the internal markets, escrow, or bonds.

In order to make traditional banking more profitable (through a decentralized
account balance database) and allow services like Paypal and Dwolla while
offering more freedom to the customers we identified (with extensive help from
many different banks and exchanges) the relevant laws required to comply with
when issuing deposit receipts. The following shall briefly discuss how
BitShares can assist to comply with those rules, technically\footnote{This
