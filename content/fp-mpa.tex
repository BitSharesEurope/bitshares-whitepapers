BitShares' market pegged assets (MPA), or \emph{Smartcoin} (as they is often also
called) are a new type of freely traded digital asset whose value is meant to
track the value of a conventional asset such as the U.S. dollar or 1 ounce
of gold. What makes market pegged assets unique is that they are free from
counter party risk.

A currency with the properties and advantages of Bitcoin that maintains price
parity with a globally adopted currency such as the US dollar has high utility
for convenient and censorship resistant commerce. A SmartCoin (synonym for
Market Pegged Asset) is a cryptocurrency that always has 100\% or more of
their value backed by the BitShares core currency, BTS, to which they can be
converted at any time at an exchange rate set by a trustworthy price
feed\footnote{Price feeds are published by delegates that have shareholder
approval.}. 

BitShares market pegged assets are a viable open source alternative to the
incumbent banking system. Achieving price parity with a commonly used currency
facilitates pricing and acceptance by merchants. Additionally it reduces the
need to calculate capital gains and losses on volatile assets to determine tax
liability. While certain risks of the system have been outlined, no system is
without risk. The current banking system allows private funds to be frozen or
confiscated without consent, such as by court order or administrative actions.
Banks and financial institutions are susceptible to insolvency. The
availability and quality of banking service varies greatly throughout the
world. BitShares brings publically auditable open source banking to anyone with
access to the internet. Market pegged assets allow savers and spenders to
choose preferred asset types. This brings flexibility and ease of use to the
open source banking experience.
 
The subsequent paragraphs will explain how market pegged assets including (for
instance) \emph{BitUSD} (intended to track the value of the US dollar)
achieve price parity while minimizing risk to holders.
