Every time an account you referred pays a transaction fee, that fee is divided
among several different accounts. The network takes a cut, and the Lifetime
Member who referred the account gets a cut.

The registrar is the account that paid the transaction fee to register the
account with the network. The registrar gets to decide how to divide the
remaining fee between themselves and their own affiliate.

Fees paid are only divided among the network, referrers, and registrars once
every maintenance interval. The paid fees are divided among tow or three
parties, depending on the parameter $d$ that can be set by the registrar:

\begin{align}
 \text{total fee} &= \text{network fee} (20\%) \notag\\
                  &\quad+ \text{registrar} (80\%\cdot(100\%-d\%)) \\
                  &\quad+ \text{referrer} (80\%\cdot(d\%)) \notag
\end{align}

Most fees are made available immediately, but fees over the vesting threshold
(such as those paid to upgrade your membership or register a premium account
name) must vest for some days as defined by the committee.
