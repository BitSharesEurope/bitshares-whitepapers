After a bond offer has been accepted, the loan period determines the due date
of the bond. If the borrower has not paid the bond by this due date, the
lender may claim the posted collateral. The bond may not be paid before the
minimum loan period has expired. The amount that must be paid by the borrower
to fulfill the bond and claim the collateral is determined by the interest rate
and the time the bond has remained outstanding. Interest accrues on a daily
basis and does not compound. A bond may also be partially paid any time after
the minimum loan period; this will return collateral to the borrower based on
the collateral ratio of the bond.
