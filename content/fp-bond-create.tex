A bond offer can be proposed by either a borrower or lender, and all open
offers can be easily searched. A borrower must commit the required collateral
to a bond offer, whereas a lender must commit borrowable assets. Bond offers
are not matched automatically with a market engine; instead, the other side of
any bond contract may be claimed via a transaction that accepts the bond offer.
