\label{sec:callorder}

A \emph{call order} is the technical term for an order of a collateralized
loan. When borrowing from the blockchain by providing collateral, a call order
is created and tied to the user's account.

This call order allows to not only keep track of loans but to also modify the
amount of collateral provided to the contract. When modifying the amount of
collateral, the only limitation is that the collateral ratio is kept above the
collateral maintenance ratio.

The collateral ratio can be derived by
\begin{align*}
 \text{r} = \frac{\text{c}}{\text{d}} \;\cdot\; p
\end{align*}

with $d$ denoting the amount of the loan, $c$ being the
amount of collateral and $p$ representing the current
fair price of the collateral in terms of the underlying asset as provided by
the price feed.

\paragraph{Example}
Assume $d = \SI{100}{USD}$ as bitUSD, $c = \SI{2500}{BTS}$ and $p = \SI{0.10}{USD \per BTS}$.
The obtained collateral ratio is
\begin{align*}
 \text{r} = \frac{\SI{2500}{BTS}}{\SI{100}{USD}} \;\cdot\; \SI{0.10}{USD \per BTS} = 2.5.
\end{align*}
Any additional collateral above the maintenance collateral ($1.75$ in case of
bitUSD) is not mandatory, but serves to protect the position against margin calls due to
volatility of the collateral asset.
