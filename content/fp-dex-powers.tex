There is no reason why the same entity needs to be responsible for issuing IOUs
and for processing the order book. It is only because these two roles are
combined that we have a tendency toward centralization in the Bitcoin exchange
space. If we want to create a decentralized exchange then the first step is to
move the order book on to the blockchain where everyone can see it.

In this model, exchanges merely become gateways that receive USD and issue
GatewayUSD on the blockchain. Later, they receive GatewayUSD and then execute
a wire transfer. They will make their money entirely on transaction fees and
not from a percentage of market fees.

The blockchain allows users to trade, for example, BitstampUSD against
BitfinexUSD, in order to easily move funds from one gateway to another. Users
could even trade BitstampUSD against BitstampBTC or BitstampUSD vs BitfinexBTC.

Unfortunately, simply moving the order book to the blockchain is not enough,
because the market will naturally centralize around a few gateway IOUs and the
markets for them. BitstampUSD is not fungible with BitfinexUSD because they
have different trust profiles and regulatory considerations. Any of these
IOUs are subject to default just like the IOUs that currently exist on the
exchanges' internal databases. What we need to do is move the trust from
individual issuers to the blockchain itself.
