In addition to market-pegged assets, the BitShares network also offers to
register customizable assets on the public ledger. For instance, a BitShares
customer may create the asset \texttt{FREE} and distribute them to friends for
free. Another customer may want his company shares to be traded in the
BitShares network. Yet another use-case would be event tickets that can be sold
at a fixed price and allow the holder to enter a concert.

Since the use-cases of these User-Issued Assets (UIA) are manifold and space is
limited in this paper, we discuss them in depth in~\cite{bts:financial}.
