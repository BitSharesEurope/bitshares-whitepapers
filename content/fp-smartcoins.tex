In today's world, crypto-currencies are unique because they are the only type
of digital currency that does not represent a corresponding counterparty
liability. Instead, they are \emph{fungible} \emph{decentralized} tokens, whose
value is derived from the amount of practical utility (or potential future
utility) perceived by the network of users that support and trade in them. Not
surprisingly, most cryptocurrencies suffer from high levels of price volatility
due to many complex factors, such as constantly shifting public perception and
highly speculative and unregulated markets. Although professional traders tend
to appreciate this volatility, so far it has hindered the widespread adoption
of cryptocurrency as a \emph{practical payment solution}.

One approach to creating a \emph{price-stable} token would be for an issuer to
accept deposits in return for a digital token as a \emph{claim receipt} (an "I
Owe You"). With this approach, the token would trade in the market as having
the same value as the underlying asset, minus any perceived credit risk
associated with the issuer. While this approach may work well for settlements,
it is far less secure as an instrument for long term savings. History has
repeatedly proven that many issuers will eventually go bankrupt due to
incompetence, government intervention or outright fraud.

On the BitShares Blockchain, there is an alternative approach to creating
\emph{price stable} digital tokens by using a cryptocurrency as
\emph{collateral} in a collateralized counterpartyrisk-free loan implemented as
smart contract. Here, the smart contract becomes the lender and requires a
security from the borrow in form of another digital token. In case of bitUSD,
anyone can borrow new bitUSD from the blockchain by providing sufficient BTS as
collateral. The smart contract autonomously and transparently ensure that each
bitUSD in existance is backed by more than 100\% (mostly even more than 175\%)
of its value in BTS. Same holds true for bitCNY. It is worth noting that the
smartcoin framework allows for customizing many of the parameters to improve
behavior and stay flexible in the longer-term. Given the nature of smart
contracts on a public blockchain, all actions are transparent and auditable.
Acountability is baked into the protocol.
