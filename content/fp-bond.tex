The BitShares bond market allows for an interest rate market between any
combination of assets tradeable on the BitShares blockchain. The bond is a
\emph{smart contract} between a borrower and a lender. The borrower borrows a
certain amount of a specified asset from the lender and secures the loan with
collateral denominated in a different asset type. Bonds are non-fungible and
each can be considered a separate contract between the two participating
parties. The borrower may use the contract to profit from an expected change
in the relative value of the two assets, while the lender enjoys a predictable
return.
