A use-case that can be easily implemented and with only minor regulatory
hurdles are \emph{reward points}, which Merchants already today offer to their
loyal customers. These points are accumulated to earn discounts on future
purchases.

Rewards systems are a prime opportunity to add value by making them available
to BitShares smart contracts. With an UIA, a merchant no longer needs to
maintain a database of customers and their rewards. Instead, he simply
transfers a crypto token to the customer (e.g. via a mobile phone application)
and the public ledger of BitShares takes over the maintenance leaving all
administrative power to the merchant (i.e. the issuer of the UIA).

Furthermore, because the issuer may set a trading fee for their UIA, merchants
can have an additional revenue stream from people trading or transferring their
rewards points.
