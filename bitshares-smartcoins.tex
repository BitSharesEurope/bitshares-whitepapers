\begin{abstract}%

 With the current growth of the crypto- ecosystem in general, and the
 growth of crypto- currencies like BTC (Bitcoin Blockchain) and ETH
 (Ethereum Blockchain) in particular, the general public as well as
 traditional (old economy) markets finally take notice of blockchain
 technology and its application(s) in the financial technology and other
 sectors. A well-known obstacle to greater adoption of crypto-currencies
 like BTC (Bitcoin) as a medium of payment is the high volatility of its
 exchange value, due to its limited supply. As a consequence, the unit
 price varies (sometimes significantly) over short periods of time. This
 makes BTC unpractical for merchants that need to pay their suppliers in
 cash, especially in bearish markets where this currency risk can ruin a
 business.

 A crypto-currency, with the properties and advantages of Bitcoin, that
 is capable of maintaining price parity with a globally adopted currency
 (e.g. U.S. Dollar), has high utility for convenient and cheap commerce.

 This document serves as a detailed and accurate description of so called
 \emph{smartcoins}, often also referred to as \emph{bitassets} or \emph{market
 pegged assets}. These refer to special kinds of tokens that are governed
 autonomously and transparently by the blockchain's internal smart contracts.
 Prominent examples are \textbf{bitUSD} and \textbf{bitCNY} which provide
 automation and incentives for market participants to maintain a high
 correlation with the value of U.S. Dollar or CNY.
