A prediction market~\cite{wiki_pm} is
a specialization of SmartCoins where there is no need for margin calls or
forced settlement because all positions are fully collateralized at any price.
A prediction market has a price between 0 and 1 and the issuer settles all
positions after the event occurs and the final price is known. These
prediction markets can be very secure if the issuer is a multi-sig account with
many independent and trustworthy parties involved.
