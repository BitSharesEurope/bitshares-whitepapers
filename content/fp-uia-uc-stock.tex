Corporate shares are heavily regulated by the SEC, but none of those
regulations prevent them from being issued or traded on an alternative trading
system~\footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative\_trading\_system}.
The regulations in many jurisdictions require all shares to be registered (aka
held by known identities). BitShares corporate shares can be used as
collateral for a bond or be used in any number of smart contracts.
