From time to time, an issuer may be required to seize funds as a result of a
court order. While this may be unappealing to crypto-currency purists, it is an
unavoidable reality of trust-based assets. An issuer can determine whether or
not they wish to revoke this privilege, but it may be a requirement in some
jurisdictions. Once again, this privilege only affects tokens of a particular
UIA and does not apply to market pegged assets as the bitUSD.
