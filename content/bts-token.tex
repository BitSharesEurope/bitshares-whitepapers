In the BitShares network the base token is called \emph{a BitShare} and carries
the abbreviation \texttt{BTS}. It is dividable into $10^5$ sub-units which are
denoted as follows:
\begin{align*}
\SI{1}{mises } &= \SI{0.00001}{BTS}\\
\SI{1}{xennon} &= \SI{0.0001}{BTS}\\
\SI{1}{oxyd  } &= \SI{0.001}{BTS}\\
\SI{1}{graphn} &= \SI{0.01}{BTS}\\
\SI{1}{epox  } &= \SI{0.1}{BTS}
\end{align*}

In general, all properties of Bitcoin also apply to BTS, namely, they have
value, can be transfered on the blockchain and are secured by elliptic curve
signatures.

In contrast to most crypto-currencies, BitShares does not claim to be a currency
but rather equity in a decentral autonomous company (DAC). As a result, the
market valuation of BitShares is free floating and may be as volatile as any
other equity (e.g. of traditional companies).

Nonetheless, BTS tokens can be used as \emph{collateral} in financial smart
contracts~\cite{bts:financial} such as market pegged assets.
