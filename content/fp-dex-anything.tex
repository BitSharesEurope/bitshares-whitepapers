BitShares offers the tools to trade in Gold, Silver, Gas, and Oil in addition
to several national currencies and cryptocurrencies. There are few limits on
what can be traded on the BitShares exchange, if there are enough people
interested to form a market. The DEX allows any two pairs to be traded
directly. There is no need to ask the exchange to open up an additional market.
If customers prefer to trade Silver:Gold directly, they can simply do it. The
BitShares exchange can support assets that can track stocks, bonds, indexes, or
inflation. Companies can issue their own stock on the BitShares network and
allow easy, low-cost trading with complete protection against naked shorting.
