A merchant wants to be able to price merchandise in BitUSD, and obtain real USD
in the bank account, in a reasonable time, with minimal risk. In this case, a
merchant would place BitUSD on the market at \$1 per BitUSD. As discussed, BTS
buyers are looking for the opportunity to buy BitUSD at that price.

A smart merchant might recognize that 1 BitUSD can actually fetch \$1 plus a
variable premium, and start preferring that customers pay them in BitUSD at
face value. An even smarter merchant might offer a discount to customers that
pay in BitUSD.
%FIXME : is it wise to use smart/smarter in a whitepaper?

In any case, merchants have a financial incentive to advertise BitUSD as the
preferred payment mechanism, because they know that \$1.00 is the lower bound
on what BitUSD is worth.
