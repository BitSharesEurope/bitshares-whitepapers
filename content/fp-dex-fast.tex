On Wall Street, traders go to great lengths to get as physically close to the
core computers as possible, because their automated trading robots make
decisions so quickly that the speed of light is a formidable factor. This gives
them an unfair advantage against other traders, and allows them to engage
borderline unethical practices such as order frontrunning. They have even spent
billions of dollars to lay transatlantic fiber optic cables between London and
New York to shave milliseconds off of their trading times.

On the BitShares DEX, all trades execute in seconds, just like with any other
centralized website interface. Unlike centralized exchanges however, there is
\emph{no prioritized trading}, front running, or hidden orders. This puts all
traders on a level playing field.
