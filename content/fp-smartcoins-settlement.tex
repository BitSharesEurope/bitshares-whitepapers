\label{sec:settlement}

Any \emph{long position} can request a so called
\emph{settlement} to convert the smartcoin into its collateral. 
The collateral is taken from the call positions that has
the least collateral ratio. If this position is insufficient to cover
the settlement, the next position with the least collateral will be used, and so on.

Settlements have an asset-specific delay and settles at the settlement price minus an offset
that is defined by the token management. However, there is a limit to the amount of smartcoins that can be settled per
\emph{maintenance interval} which can be updated by the token management.
Furthermore, the settlement offset is paid by the person requesting settlement
to the person providing the collateral as a compensation.
