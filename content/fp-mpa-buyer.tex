A buyer with dollars, looking to buy BTS, knows that 1 BitUSD can be used to
buy \$1 worth of BTS (plus the current premium). He also knows that this premium
can never be negative, because of the option to force-settle at the price feed.
In this situation, he can know with certainty that if he can convince someone
with BitUSD to sell for \$1.00, he can buy more BTS than if he simply buys BTS
with his dollars directly. The higher the premium, the more incentive exists to
buy BitUSD for \$1.00.

This means that, in a BTS bear market, the BitUSD price gives the highest
premium of the BTS price, and BitUSD becomes the easiest to sell. In practice,
the BitUSD:USD market will reflect the premium, and traders will usually be
unable to find anyone willing to sell for exactly \$1.00.

If a buyer is looking to purchase a large quantity of BTS without moving the
price, he can start by buying up BitUSD with dollars. This will slowly raise
the BitUSD:USD price, which is a signal to other market participants. A careful
buyer might be able to avoid signaling the market. Then, after acquiring the
position in BitUSD, the buyer can request a global settlement and get the price
feed on the entire purchase.

Because all positions and trades are visible on the blockchain, all of this
trading activity can be factored into the price, minimizing any potential
profits to be made by attempted manipulation.
