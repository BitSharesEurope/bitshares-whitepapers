Of course, you can trade any amount, at any time, from anywhere, without
withdrawal limits\footnote{Restricted access may only apply to user issued
assets (e.g. IOUs of gateways), but not to market pegged assets, such as
bitUSD, bitEUR, etc.}. All other legally compliant exchanges have daily
withdrawal limits. Those who wish to exceed standard limits must provide
increasingly invasive levels of documentation. Some exchanges, such as
Coinbase~\cite{coinbase}, even limit what you can do with your money after you
have withdrawn it~\cite{ct:compliance}. Other exchanges demand documentation of
how you earned your cryptocurrency.

With BitShares, no one must approve your account, so you have complete
financial freedom.
