The traditional banking system has long practiced what is called
\emph{fractional} reserve banking, but in many cases the more appropriate term
is ``\emph{fictional}'' reserve banking. In the BitShares ecosystem, however,
we demand at least 100\% reserves. Every Dollar, Euro, bitcoin and ounce of
gold held as a SmartCoin on the BitShares DEX is backed by at least, but often
greater than 100\% reserves.  In a centralized exchange, a single hack,
mistake, or theft can quickly turn a 100\% reserve system into a fractional
reserve system, or worse, a "fictional" reserve system. Without any reserves,
it is unlikely that an exchange would ever be able to pay back the funds it
owes to its customers.

Because the BitShares DEX always maintains a minimum of 100\% reserves, users
can rest assured that BitShares will be solvent in almost any market. Since all
of the reserves are kept as BTS held in collateral on the blockchain, they
cannot be compromised because there are no private keys that can be stolen.
