Accounts in BitShares are separated into three groups. We decided to give users
the option to upgrade their accounts into a VIP-like status if they desire and
profit from reduced fees and additional features.

A \emph{regular} account is a \emph{non-member}.

\emph{Lifetime Members} get a percentage cashback on every transaction fee they
pay and qualify to earn referral income (see below) from users they register
with or refer to the network. A Lifetime membership is associated with a
certain one-time fee that is defined by the committee and qualifies for reduced
transaction fees.

If a lifetime membership is too much you can still get the same cashback for
the next year by becoming an annual subscriber for a smaller one-time fee which
lasts for only one year and qualifies for reduced transactions fee during that
time.
