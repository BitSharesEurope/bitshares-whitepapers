The old BitShares 1.0 protocol went to great effort to avoid market
manipulation and eliminate the supposed evil of front running. To stop front
running, all orders were matched at the exact price specified in the order. Any
overlap in the market was captured as fees. This means that to get the best
price, a client would have been forced to submit many orders manually matching
each order. This had the side effect of slowing down how quickly someone could
walk the book. This slow down effect was pitched as protection against market
manipulation attacks on Smartcoins.

Experience has taught us that the lack of standard limit orders has harmed
market liquidity and adoption. BitShares 2.0 matches orders on a
\emph{first-come, first-serve basis} and gives the buyer the best price
possible up to the limit. Rather than charging unpredictable fees from market
overlap, the network charges a defined fee based upon the size of the order
matched and the assets involved. Each asset issuer gets an opportunity to
configure their fees as described in~\cref{seq:feepool}.
