Cryptocurrencies depend upon a public ledger ,which makes privacy challenging,
because everyone can see every transaction. Bitcoin gives every user one or
more account numbers, and that gives many people a false sense of security.
People assume that as long as no one knows your account number and you use a
new account number with every transaction that no one can tie all of your
bitcoins to your real life identity.

This is where the large centralized exchanges become a problem. In order to
comply with government regulations, exchanges must know everyone they do
business with. Since many bitcoin transactions flow through an exchange, the
exchange learns who everyone is and can start to track who is doing business
with whom. Coinbase is already closing
accounts~\footnote{https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/coinbase-bringing-big-brother-bitcoin-accounts/}
based upon who you do business with after withdrawing your bitcoins.

In order to have even the slightest bit of privacy, the exchange functionality
needs to be divided among hundreds of parties who are unlikely to collude to
compromise identity. This is not economically practical today, because the
exchange order book creates market incentives that naturally tend toward
centralization in just a few exchanges with the vast majority of market share.

In BitShares, your identify need only be verified by issuers of IOUs (e.g.
ccedkUSD) in order to comply with fiat regulations. Once traded for bitUSD your
link to ccedk can be removed quickly by means of \emph{blinded transactions}
that allow to publicly move funds without revealing the exact
amount~\cite{}. If issuers approve, blinded transactions may even be performed
for UIAs directly.
