In addition to the aforementioned \emph{market pegged} assets, BitShares allows
individuals and companies to create and issue their own tokens for anything
they can imagine. The potential use cases for so called user-issued assets
(UIA) are innumerable. One example would be for UIAs to be used as simple event
tickets deposited on the customer's mobile phone to pass the entrance of a
concert. On the other hand, they can be used for crowd funding, ownership
tracking or even to sell equity of a company in form of stock.

Obviously, the regulations that apply to each kind of token vary widely and are
often different in every jurisdiction. Hence, BitShares comes with tools that
allow issuers to remain compliant with all applicable regulations when issuing
assets, assuming regulators allow such assets in the first place. We will
discuss the tools and optional administrative rights given to the issuers of a
given UIA and provide a subset of possible use-cases in more detail.
