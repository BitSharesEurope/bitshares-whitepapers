In most countries Corporate shares are heavily regulated by their corresponding
exchange authority, such as the \emph{Securities and Exchange Commission} (SEC)
in the U.S. However, most of those regulations do not prevent them from being
issued or traded on an alternative trading system~\cite{altTrade}. The
regulations in many jurisdictions require all shares to be registered (a.k.a.
held by known identities). 

Since the BitShares network offers whitelisting for customers of UIA according
to \cref{sec:uia:restrictions}, corporate shares can certainly be issued and
traded in the BitShares ecosystem (see \cref{sec:dex}).

When issuing a corporate share in BitShares, the company can decide who is able
to hold, share, or transfer its shares and can restrict trading markets freely
(e.g. only allow the market STOCK:bitUSD but not STOCK:bitGOLD).

% Additionally, BitShares corporate shares can be used as collateral for a bonds
% or be used in any number of smart contracts.
