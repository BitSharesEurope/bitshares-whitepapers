Customers use BitUSD because it provides them the convenience and freedom of a
cryptocurrency, and has lower transfer fees compared to most other payment
platforms besides being significantly more convenient than fiat.

A customer looking to buy goods and services with BitUSD finds himself paying a
premium to acquire BitUSD from the market. This means that customers will
prefer merchants that offer a discount equal to the premium paid. On the other
hand, the premium is a wash for a customer that \emph{earned} BitUSD at a
nominal value of \$1.00.

In fact, the only people to whom the premium matters are those who are looking
to \emph{enter} or \emph{exit} the ecosystem. Once a customer or merchant is
within the ecosystem, it is easy to simply trade BitUSD at parity, even if it
is theoretically worth slightly more outside the ecosystem.

Of course, merchants and customers are free to negotiate the best way to split
the premium, and the free market will take care of the rest. In the meantime,
all participants can rest assured that BitUSD is always worth \emph{at least}
\$1, and can consider the premium for entering the ecosystem as a one-time fee
comparable to fees required for the exchange of foreign currencies.
