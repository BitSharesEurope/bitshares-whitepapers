\begin{abstract}%
 BitShares 2.0 is an industrial-grade decentralized platform built for
 high-performance financial smart contracts. In order to show its capabilities
 in the field, we have conducted a stress test on the public testnet. The
 testnet has been deployed with the identical code base that is used for
 the BitShares network and has nodes around the globe. A multi-phase
 stress-test has been proposed and accepted that modifies the maximum
 transaction size, maximum block size and block confirmation times in the live
 network during the stress test. Validators have been kept up to date by means
 of stake-weighted voting~\cite{bts:general}.
