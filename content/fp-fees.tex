In the BitShares ecosystem every operation is assigned a certain fee. These
fees are subject to change. However, they are defined solely by shareholder
approval and, hence, every shareholder of the BitShares core asset (BTS) has a
say as to what the fees should be. Hence, if shareholders can be convinced to
reduce a certain fee and consensus is reached, the fee will be reduces
automatically by the blockchain.

The following fees are associated with the DEX and financial instruments:

Some more fees are available on the protocol level but are not a subject of
this paper. Which fees currently apply can be extracted from the blockchain and
will certainly be put on a distinct information page of most wallet software.
