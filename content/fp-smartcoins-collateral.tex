\label{sec:collateral}

As previously mentioned, the collateral is used to secure the debt of a
collateralized loan. While any asset on the BitShares Blockchain could
technically be used as collateral asset for a smart coin, most smartcoins
use the core native token BTS, exclusively.

Collateral needs to be provided in order to borrow smartcoins from the
blockchain. The provided collateral will be locked away and can only be
redeemed back when clearing the debt with the blockchain.

Even though the collateral is locked and tied to the user's account, other uses
may obtain your collateral in parts of fully by so called \emph{settlements}
(see below).
