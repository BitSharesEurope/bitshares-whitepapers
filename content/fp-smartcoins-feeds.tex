\label{sec:feeds}

The blockchain needs to be aware of a fair valuation of the token and its
collateral (think, the value of BTS in USD) in order to enable margin calls
(see below) and allow for settlements (see below) to convert tokens into the
collateral token at a fair price.

A feed constitutes multiple attributes including
\begin{description}
 \item[price] of the token with respect to the collateral of the smartcoin,
  e.g., the BTS price in USD.
 \item[maximum short squeeze ratio]: Given that margin calls are force to buy
  in the markets, this ratio defines the upper bound for the premium that needs
  to be paid in case of a margin call.
 \item[maintenance collateral ratio]: This parameter defines the minimum
  required collateral as a ratio between the token and the value of the
  collateral denoted in token. If the collateral ratio of any call order (a
  borrow position) comes below this ratio, a margin call for the call order is
  triggered.
\end{description}

These parameters are in the hands of the group selected by the owner of the
smartcoin. Only those are allowed to produce valid price feeds for a particular
smartcoin. 

When feed producers generate their feed price,
they usually obtain a fair valuation by considering the exchange rates for the
smartcoin and collateral on multiple exchanges and trading platforms and combine them to
reflect a fair price. Feed producers are recommended to keep track of external price
movements and update their price feed accordingly. A common approach is to use volume-weighted 
averaging to account for trading volume on individual exchanges, though there is freedom in the exact
price calculations, making the overall result  more reliable.

Additionally, to prevent manipulation of the price feed (and the other
parameters), $N$ feed producers have to be set that can all produce their feeds
independently. Having a set of $N$ feeds $p_i,\;1<i<N$, the protocol obtains a price $\tilde{p}$ by the
use of the \emph{median} according to:
\begin{align}
 x &= \operatorname{sort}(p[i])\\
 \tilde p &=\begin{cases}
   x[\frac{N+1}{2}]                                               & N \text{ odd}\\
   \frac {1}{2}\left(x[{\frac{N}{2}}] + x[\frac{N}{2} + 1]\right) & N \text{ even.}
 \end{cases}
\end{align}
Hence, the price, as well as the other parameters, are resistant against
misbehaving witnesses in that only a \textbf{majority} of feed producers can
manipulate the outcome of the median. In practice, any unintentional feed
\emph{error} is thus balanced around the median value.

Ultimately, we end up with a trusted and fair price for the smart coin at which
we can execute margin calls and settlements.
