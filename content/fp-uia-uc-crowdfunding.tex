With BitShares, decentralized crowd funding becomes an easy task. Technically
the process breaks down to as few as two steps:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
 \item Create and issue a new token that should represent your project, and 
 \item sell your shares on an exchange.
\end{inparaenum}
The issuer is now free to choose to sell them for bitUSD, bitEUR, or any other
token and is free to define the price for each share. Not only can these shares
be traded on traditional (centralized) exchanges but they can also be traded in
the decentral exchange that will be discussed in \cref{sec:dex}.

Whether the UIAs are used as a transferable coupon for a pre-sale, or doing an
initial public offering (IPO) on a small company, issuing an asset is one of
the most effective means of raising money for a cause.
