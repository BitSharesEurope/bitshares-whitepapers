With BitShares, decentralized crowd funding never was easier. Technically the
process breaks down to as few as two steps:
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item Create a new token that should represent your project, and 
\item issue and sell your shares on the DEX.
\end{inparaenum}
The issuer is now free to choose to sell them for bitUSD, bitEUR, or any other
token and free to define the price for each share.

Whether being used as a transferable coupon for a pre-sale, or doing an IPO on
a small company, issuing an asset is one of the most effective means of raising
money for a cause.
