All guarantees of SmartCoins are subject to the caveat that a SmartCoin can
never be worth more than the collateral backing the least-collateralized short
position. In normal market conditions, the value of the collateral is always
more than sufficient, but, from time to time, markets can rapidly revalue the
collateral. If this revaluation happens faster than the short positions can be
forced to cover, then all SmartCoins are liquidated at the exchange rate of the
least collateralized short position. This is similar to an insolvent bank
converting its deposits to equity.
