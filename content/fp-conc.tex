The BitShares network offers financial instruments for everyone to use at a low
fee. Not only is there a decentral exchange (DEX) but also smartcoins and user
issued assets.

% DEX
The DEX allows for trade of any arbitrary pair of assets issued on the
BitShares blockchain. The order-matching algorithm is equivalent to most
central exchanges and allows to directly fill a given order or walk-the-books
up to a given price by means of a limit order.

% MPA
SmartCoins are a powerful tool for everyone from speculators and savers, to
traders and entrepreneurs. The BitShares platform provides a toolset with which
innovators can experiment to find optimal currency solutions using free market
discovery. It was shown that in order to achieve a price \emph{predictability},
a price floor of \$1.00 USD per bitUSD is most reasonable. Hence, any long
position can be settled at the price feed.

%UIA
Additionally, we have shown that user issued assets (UIA) offer countless
opportunities to reduce costs. Not only can they be used to simply store a
token on a decentralized database (the blockchain), but it was also shown that
IOUs can be issued complying with regulations.

% %Bonds
% The Bitshares bond market allows investors who wish to gain leverage in a
% particular asset to offer competitive interest rates to those willing to commit
% capital for a specified time. The implementation of a bond market on a
% blockchain consensus system efficiently reduces the overhead and counterparty
% risk typically associated with such contracts.

Thus, the foundations of the BitShares network have been laid out to shift the
paradigm of classical banking towards peer-to-peer financing at large scale.
