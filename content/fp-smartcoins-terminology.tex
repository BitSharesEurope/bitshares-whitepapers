In this paper we refer to \emph{smartcoins} as a means for customization of
tokens within a \emph{framework} of smart contracts and parameters as offered
by the BitShares Blockchain. In literature, smartcoins are also often referred
to as \emph{bitassets} or \emph{market pegged asset}.

As such, tokens like \emph{bitUSD}, \emph{bitCNY} and others are merely cases
specific to one particular use.
