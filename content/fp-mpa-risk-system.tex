Systemic risk is a catch-all for other risks required to utilize the system.
The primary risk is individuals are responsible for protecting the
cryptographic private keys that sign transactions proving ownership of assets.
These keys must be protected from theft or loss. This risk can be greatly
reduced and virtually eliminated by following best practices.

Systemic risk also includes the possibility of an overlooked fatal flaw in the
open source software or the possibility of large scale failure of global
network infrastructure. While some risk components should drastically reduce
over time, such as implementation bugs and computational bottle necks, others
are constant and difficult to predict, such as politics (i.e. legislation,
regulations, etc.) or natural catastrophes that may result in partial or global
internet outages.
