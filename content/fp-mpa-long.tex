The very first buyer of BitUSD will have to pay the lowest premium set by the
shorters. For the sake of discussion, let's assume the first BitUSD was created
in a bear market and cost \$1.05 to create. The holder of that BitUSD has two
options: sell it on the market for \$1.04, or request forced settlement for
\$1.00. Clearly, the forced settlement option would only be used in situations
where there was a decrease in total demand for BitUSD and there were no offers
to buy it above \$1.00.

As a trader only looking to trade back and forth between BitUSD and BTS, this
premium doesn't matter. Such a trader is exposed to volatility in the premium,
but that risk is limited to \$0.05 in this example. In practice, the premium is
expected to be relatively stable and predictable.

% FIXME: the above statement contradicts the statements in the previous
%        paragraph where it was stated that bull and bear markets have very
%        different premiums!
