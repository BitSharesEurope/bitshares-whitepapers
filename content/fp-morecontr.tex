In contrast Bitcoin that offers \emph{Script} --- a stack-based scripting
language with a reduced set of instructions (called \emph{OP codes}) --- to
allow for limited smart contracting capabilities, the BitShares network allows
for arbitrary transactions types, in general.

However, in contrast to so called \emph{Turing-complete} blockchain projects,
such as Ethereum, adding new features or transaction types to the protocol
requires shareholder consensus.

Hence, new features must be \emph{proposed} to the shareholders who must reach
consensus to approve them. Only after this happens is the protocol then
upgraded to the next version which includes the new feature set.
