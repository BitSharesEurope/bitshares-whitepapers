Unlike many attempts to create a digital asset that tracks the dollar, market
pegged asset are not an ``I owe you'' issued by any entity. For this reason, it
does not rely on a specific counterparty to honor its value. Although
manipulation risk occurs in any market, it is minimized by the open source and
auditable nature of the BitShares system and carefully considered market rules.
BitAssets stored on an exchange become IOUs and are subject to counter party
risk just like storing bitcoin or bitshares on an exchange. This risk is not a
property of the BitAssets themselves. We recomend that users never deposit
BitAssets on an exchange and instead only use gateways that issue their IOUs
onto the BitShares network. This way you can trade your BitUSD against gateway
IOUs without exposing your BitUSD to counter party risk while in the order
book.
