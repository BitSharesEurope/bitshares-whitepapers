We would like to thank every one that has participated in the
stress-test for block validation, transaction generation and setup of a
robust Peer-2-Peer network. We would like to further acknowledge the
assistance during the preparations of the stress-test and the feedback
we have received while writing this paper. Last but not least we
appreciate the financial support given by each and everyone that has
been running a machine for the stress-test and BitShares-Munich for
providing the major API node on bitshares.eu.
