When deciding a price at which to enter a short order, a trader must consider
the risk of forced settlement. In this case, no trader will attempt to short at
or below the price feed, because they could be forced to settle at the price
feed. In fact, a smart trader would allow enough of a spread to account for the
risk of being forced to settle at a feed price that was off by a small amount.
In practice, the risk posed by the feed error is balanced equally between being
in the favor of the short and in the favor of the long, leaving only the risk
of being forced out of their position at an inopportune time.

A short can minimize their exposure to the feed by providing enough collateral
to keep far above the least collateralized positions, and thus very unlikely to
be forced to settle at the feed or at an inopportune time.

In practice, the only way new BitUSD enters circulation is if there is someone
willing to pay enough of a premium to convince a short to provide guaranteed
liquidity at the price feed on demand, while also covering the cost of exchange
rate risk. This premium will be higher for the backing crypto-currency in a bear
market, and will be lower in a bull market.

Someone who is short has only one way to exit their position: by buying BitUSD
off the market. This means that a short must also factor in the risk that the
premium may change. If a short position is entered in a bull market with a 0.1\%
premium, it may be forced to exit during a bear market with a 5\% premium. In
this event a short position is exposed to both exchange rate of the dollar vs.
BTS and the premium risk. On the other hand, a short entered during a bear
market with a 5\% premium may get to cover during a bull market with a 0.1\%
premium.

For all intents and purposes, the premium is expected to move in the same
direction as the price, and thus speculators who only care about relative price
changes can ignore the premium.
