The original grandmother prototype formerly called angel-shares (AGS) in
reference to the patron \emph{angels} who once funded the performing arts.
That's why AGS are \emph{not liquid}. (No one can trade the proof that you were
the once willing to donate to this cause.) 

The donations have been recorded in the public blockchain of bitcoin which now
acts as a \emph{book of honorable donors}. The bitcoin address used as donation
address was 
\begin{center}
 \texttt{1ANGELwQwWxMmbdaSWhWLqBEtPTkWb8uDc}
\end{center}
Note, that the donation period for AGS lasting 200 days has ended already and
that donations to this address never resulted nor will result in any
obligations whatsoever.

%% BTS Genesis
Having attracted two different groups of investors with a mined crypto token
via PTS and a donation based book of donors via AGS, everyone had a chance to
participate and be rewarded with stake in the genesis block of BitShares 1.0.
This genesis block solely consisted of AGS and PTS holders on a 50\%/50\% ratio
such that the BTS tokens initially issued by this genesis can be considered
\emph{well distributed}.

%% Social consensus update
However, ever since the BitShares network has launched, the social consensus
has shifted towards \emph{sharedropping} onto holders of BTS directly instead
of PTS/AGS.
