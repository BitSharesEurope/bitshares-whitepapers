Having defined \emph{operations}, we can now put these into a \emph{list of
operations} and construct a \emph{transaction}.

\begin{verbatim}
{
   "ref_block_num": ...,
   "ref_block_prefix": ...,
   "expiration": [...],
   "extensions": [...],
   "operations": [...],
   "signatures": [...],
}
\end{verbatim}

In addition to its operations, a transaction also consists of 
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
 \item an expiration date,
 \item a reference block number,
 \item a reference block prefix,
 \item a set of extensions, and
 \item a set of signatures to authorize each operation.
\end{inparaenum}
