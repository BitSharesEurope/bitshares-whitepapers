Event tickets are a largely unregulated use case for user-issued assets.
Tickets to a school play could be issued as digital tokens that are auctioned
off to the highest bidder, who would then resell them. This ensures that the
ticket issuer raises as much money as possible up front, while transferring the
risk of ticket sales on to speculators. On the day of the event, the issuer
can freeze all trading of the asset and then allow users to cryptographically
check in.

Furthermore, the blockchain maintains the database of tickets which drastically
reduces the organizational overhead.
