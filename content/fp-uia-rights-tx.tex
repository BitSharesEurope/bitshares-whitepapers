A transfer-restricted asset allows the holders of the asset to trade it in the
markets but not transfer it from person to person. Only a few cryptocurrency
exchanges allow user-to-user transfer of funds outside the market, because this
particular activity is often subject to a different set of money transmission
regulations.

The deposit receipt example is probably one of the most important, and yet most
heavily regulated, use cases of user-issued assets.
