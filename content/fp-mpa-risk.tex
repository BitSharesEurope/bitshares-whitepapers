The current implementation of market pegged assets in the BitShares system is
designed to minimize risk of loss to market pegged asset holders. Short
positions are opened with collateral worth three times the market value of the
asset. The initial collateral is comprised of the BTS paid by the buyer for the
asset and twice this amount of BTS contributed by the short seller. The
collateral requirements and margin triggers were chosen conservatively to
protect the holders of market pegged assets from volatility of the underlying
collateral. Forcing short positions to cover every 30 days provides additional
assurance of short term liquidity. Control over the price feed is distributed
among over 50 separately elected delegates who compile information from
multiple exchange sources. Despite such precautions, it is important to
carefully explore risks of using the system. Risks can be broadly categorized
as value risk, counterparty risk, or systemic risk.
