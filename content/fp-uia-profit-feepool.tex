Issuers may optionally maintain a Fee Pool. The Fee Pool is a pool of BTS and
an exchange rate at which the issued asset may be converted into BTS. When a
user wishes to pay a network fee with the asset, the fee pool will step in to
convert the asset into BTS at the rate that the issuer has specified. This
means that issuers may charge a premium every time users opt to use their asset
to pay network fees rather than paying them directly with BTS.

The purpose of the fee pool is to provide a convenience to users that would
like to use an asset without concerning themselves with the details of
acquiring BTS. Anyone may fund the fee pool, but only the issuer may specify
the exchange rate. This exchange rate is automatically set to the settlement
price if the asset is collateralized by BTS.
