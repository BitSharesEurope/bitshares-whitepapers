Since we use Graphene as our underlying technology, most blockchain parameters
can be changed in real-time with no need for protocol upgrades or hard forks.

In contrast to the public BitShares network, the majority of the stake in the
public testnet is owned by BitShares Europe which allowed us to change the
parameters without the need to coordinate with other stakeholders.

This allowed us to setup a multiple phase stress-test that went through a set of
different blockchain parameters to gradually increase the amount of
processed transactions on the blockchain.
