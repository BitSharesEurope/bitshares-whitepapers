\begin{abstract}%
 BitShares 2.0 is an industrial-grade decentralized platform built for
 high-performance financial smart contracts. In order to show its capabilities
 in the field, we have conducted a stress test on the public testnet. The
 testnet has been deployed with the same code base that is used for
 the BitShares network and has nodes around the globe. Only margin changes have
 been made to distinguish the testnet from the productive network, properly. A
 multi-phase stress-test has been proposed and accepted that modifies the
 maximum transaction size, maximum block size and block confirmation times in
 the live network during the stress test. Validators have been kept up to date
 by means of stake-weighted voting~\cite{bts:general}.
